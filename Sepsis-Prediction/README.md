### Sepsis Prediction

Sepsis is a very serious problem that happens when the body reacts badly to an infection, causing harm to tissues, organs, or even death. Around the world, about 30 million people get sepsis each year, and 6 million of them don't survive. This includes around 4.2 million babies and kids (according to WHO). It's super important to find sepsis early and treat it with antibiotics quickly because waiting even just an hour to start treatment can make the chance of survival go down by 4-8%.
